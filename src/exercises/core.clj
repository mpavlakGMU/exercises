;;Tom Observations:
;;Why are we using *' ?  That's arbitrary-precision multiplication,
;;i.e. BigInt, which carries a non-trivial performance cost to gain
;;use the ability to work with potentially massive numbers.
;;We typically don't ever need to use this, since the numeric tower
;;in clojure will automatically promote our stuff to bigints if we
;;overflow.  Stick with normal multiplication via * unless you
;;actually need bigint-specific arithmetic (highly rare).
;;Additional notes are prepended with T: ....

;;=========File IO=============

;;T:Regarding java interop and file I/O, by using these classes
;;instead of the baked in functions from clojure.java.io, you're going
;;to incur a serious hit in terms of Reflection costs.  That is, the
;;JVM can't infer what the type of the args are and which method to
;;dispatch based on for your objects, so it'll reflect, on EACH call.
;;This ends up being a canonical and preventable speed hit in
;;clojure....one of the first things you want to do is avoid
;;reflection entirely.  Fortunately, the clojure libraries already do
;;this for you, but if you end up doing interop with java libraries or
;;things that aren't already wrapped in clojure, you should generally:
;;(set! *warn-on-reflection* true) This will give you warnings when
;;the clojure compiler has to use reflection.

;;T: importing in the middle of function is bad form.  Do it at the
;;beginning of the file in the (ns ...) declaration.
(defn read-file [filename]
  (import java.util.Scanner java.io.File)

                                                      (.next scan) nil))))))

;;T: This is a common idiom.  Also look at
;;spork.util.general/line-reducer and other utilities for getting
;;lines from files.  Note: line-seq is lazy, while reduce is eager,
;;thus reduce forces the line-sequence to be traversed and realized to
;;build up the resulting vector...

  (with-open [r (clojure.java.io/reader filename)]

;;T: version with type-hinting...using with-open to eliminate the need for
;;manual resource management.  When wrapping java objects, it's common to
;;look up the api via ala
