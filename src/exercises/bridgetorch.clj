;; A second problem (classic):

;; Four people come to a river in the night.
;; There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time.
;; They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when 
;; crossing the bridge.

;; Person A can cross the bridge in one minute, B in two minutes, C in five 
;; minutes, and D in eight minutes.

;; When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower 
;; person's pace.

;; The question is, can they all get across the bridge in 15 minutes or less?
